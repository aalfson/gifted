Gifted is a birthday gift recommendation app for Svpply and Zappos customers. The app connects to your Svpply account, checks to see if any of your wants are available on Zappos.com, and then sends an email 2 weeks before your birthday to up to 5 of your friends with birthday gift ideas. 

To us Gifted, you must have a [Svpply](http://www.svpply.com "Svpply") account. Additionally, you must like at least one item available on Zappos.com in order to receive the email. For demonstration purposes, I suggest 'wanting' the following items: 

[French Press](https://svpply.com/item/346547/Bodum_EILEEN_French_Press_Coffee)
[New Balance Shoes](https://svpply.com/item/960340/New_Balance_Classics_ML574_at_Zapposcom)
[New Balance Shoes](https://svpply.com/item/358000/New_Balance_Classics_U420_Grey)

It will take a couple of minutes for the Svpply's cache to update with your recent 'wants'. Gifted will not be able to send out an email with your gift ideas until Svpply's cache has updated. 

Next, visit [Gifted](http://gifted.herokuapp.com), a register a new account. You will be prompted to allow Gifted read access to your Svpply account. Continue the registration instructions - please provide your name, birthday, and the email addresses of up to 5 of your friends and family you want to receive your birthday gift idea email. To see the email your friends and family receive, click the "Send Sample Email" button on the registration confirmation page or the app's landing page, then check your email inbox.
